## About the project
Lo-fi and pixel-art themed virtual study environment, equipped with a lofi music player, timer, to-do list and a clock. This project was essentially born out of my desire for an all-in-one space for all my study needs throughout university 🎓

Teach stack: React, Firebase, Material UI
